# CI breaks when updating this file to bazel 8.
# See https://github.com/bazel-contrib/rules-template/issues/138

# The first line of this file is used by Bazelisk and Bazel to be sure
# the right version of Bazel is used to build and test this repo.
# This also defines which version is used on CI.
#
# Note that you should also run integration_tests against other Bazel
# versions you support.
